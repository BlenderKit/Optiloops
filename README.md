Optiloops is a blender 3d addon for optimizing topology.  
  
It goes through loops of the mesh and removes loops selectively by several constraints:  
  -max/min face angle present on the loop  
  keep by:  
    -seams  
    -bevel  
    -crease  
    -influencing loops essentials for subsurf shape (offset edges)  
 now repeatable with shift R doing sel result before (selecting remaining geo when dissolve on)
